First we need to make sure we are on the right branch
To checkout branch:
--->git checkout branchname

Then we perform our changes and follow these steps:

1.) Checking all the modified and untacked files --> git status or git status | grep modi
Staging the files to be commited --> git add filename

2.) commiting staged files --> git commit -m "commit msg"

3.) Pushing file to your branch-->git push

4.) Then raise pull request and merge upon approval.

5.) checking git logs--> git log

In case you commited wrong files it better to revert the commit using soft reset.
