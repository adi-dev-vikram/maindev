Install git on your linux machines
--> sudo apt-get install git ( debian )
--> sudo yum install git ( RHEL)
Install ssh packages
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
create pair of public and private keys:
ssh-keygen -t rsa or just ssh-keygen
Enter passphrase for these or just save them. These are saved in home dir for current user.
Use cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to view the public key. Then past it in the host server.

Once these steps are done we need to make sure /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf are edited and resolve to the IPs.
